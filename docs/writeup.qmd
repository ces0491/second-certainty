# Project Description

Second Certainty addresses one of life's two certainties—taxes—by providing South African individuals and small businesses with an intuitive platform for managing tax liabilities throughout the fiscal year. 

Traditional tax management often occurs reactively at year-end, leading to unexpected liabilities, missed deductions, and financial stress. This application transforms this approach by implementing a proactive, year-round tax management system that continuously calculates estimated tax liabilities based on income streams, identifies potential deductions, forecasts provisional payments, and provides optimization strategies—all in real-time.

The system combines up-to-date South African tax regulations with personal financial data to deliver accurate tax calculations, visualizations, and strategic recommendations, helping users optimize their tax position throughout the year rather than scrambling at tax season.

# Deployment

The Second Certainty application is deployed on Render's free tier, which may result in slow initial load times after periods of inactivity. When logging in, please note that you may need to retry after `No response from server` message - this is a function of deployment on Render's free tier which experiences "cold starts" after 15 minutes of inactivity.

**Live Application URLs:**
- **Frontend Application**: [https://second-certainty.onrender.com](https://second-certainty.onrender.com)
- **Backend API**: [https://second-certainty-api.onrender.com](https://second-certainty-api.onrender.com)
- **API Documentation**: [https://second-certainty-api.onrender.com/api/docs](https://second-certainty-api.onrender.com/api/docs)

**Performance Considerations:**
- Initial load times may exceed 30 seconds due to service "spin-up" on free tier
- Subsequent requests are fast once the service is active
- Database queries are optimized for performance despite platform limitations

For more detailed information on deployment, please refer to the following documentation:
